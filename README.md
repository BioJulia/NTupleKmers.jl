# NTupleKmers.jl

**EXPERIMNTAL: Potential replacement for BioSequences.jl kmers, supporting much longer K.**

This repository is experimental, so there are currently no docs, and users not
intimate with efficiently dealing with ntuples, bit-flipping, and the internal
and user facing behaviours of BioSequences may not get much help using this.

And that's ok, because this is experimental. If it's meant to be, it will make
its way into [BioSequences.jl](https://biojulia.net/BioSequences.jl.stable),
which is where you should go for a useable kmer type.
